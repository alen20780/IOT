started learning Arduino 
wrote embedded c
used Arduino uno

pinMode(pinNumber,HIGH/LOW)

blink 1 led
blink 3 led with 1sec delay

digitaWrite(bpin, HIGH/LOW )
digitalRead(pinNumber) for 0 / 1

buzzer when blinking each led using HDX TMB 12A O5

analogWrite(bpin, intensity) in case of led (bp, brightness)
 AnalogWrite uses pulse width modulation (PWM), turning a digital pin on and off very quickly with different ratio between on and off, to create a fading effect.

tone(bpin, freq, time)

used MQ-2 COMBUSTABLE GASS, SMOKE
MQ-3 ALCHOHOL
MQ-4 METHANE, PROPANE, BUTANE

analogRead(pinNumber) returns a number between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the amount of voltage being applied to the pin.

thermocouple
rtd(resistance temperature detector)
thermistor

semiconductor

DHT11 standalone(temperature and humidity)
